    <p><strong>Integration of the Python Language into the Accounting Profession:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integration</strong> - my profession, Chartered Accountancy, has a combination of both ad
                    hoc and repetitive tasks. Repetitive tasks such as daily, weekly and monthly reporting can be fully
                    automated through Python Object Orientated Programming(OOP);</li>
                <li><strong>Sentiments</strong> - I am able to quantify, both quantitatively and graphically, human
                    emotions such as customer satisfaction, anger, happiness, etc. through a code;</li>
                <li><strong>Market Trends</strong> - through the use of Application Programming Interfaces(APIs), I am
                    able to programmatically follow get an automatic alert on the stocks that I have on my personal
                    portfolio;</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Economy</strong> - Coding assists me to quickly manipulate data sets in order to
                meet organisational needs, handle the growth of data volumes and complexity and finally tap into data
                (including non-financial) currently not being utilised through the use of data processing and analysis
                expertise;</li>
                <li><strong>Applications</strong> - I can create desktop applications using Graphical User
                    Interfaces(GUIs) that enable clients (users) with no coding or programming experience to use such
                applications to provide information that is useful to accountants in data processing, data science and
                    decision-making. GUIs are useful in that one can customise accounting and finance applications for,
                    inter alia, data visualisation.</li>
            </ul>
